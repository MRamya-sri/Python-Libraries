# PYTHON-LIBRARIES
This repository contains my several Python libraries used in data science and machine learning: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow.

## Libraries

### NumPy

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

- A powerful N-dimensional array object
- Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
- Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

### pandas

pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source data analysis and data manipulation library built on top of the Python programming language.


### Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.



### TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML, and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.

## Installation

To use these libraries, you'll need to install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow
